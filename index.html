                <h2>Youtubability</h2>
                <p>
                    A key driver of youtubality is the <strong class="darkShade">clarity of your gameplay </strong>
                    to a potential player.
                </p>
                <p>Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game
                    by working on getting the potential of your game by working on getting
                    <strong class="darkShade">the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.</p>

                <p>Many elements can be used to make your game clearer.
                </p>
                <p>For instance ask yourself if a user's interaction with the game is <strong class="darkShade">evident</strong> for
                    example, can she tell which character she <strong class="darkShade">controls?</strong> Is the <strong class="darkShade">objective
                        clear?</strong>
                    Does it look <strong class="darkShade">fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second(great!) or
                    after 10 seconds(too long!)
                </p>

                <p>

                    Make sure to <strong class="darkShade">use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules.For instance, in Helix
                    Jump, obstacles are <strong class="darkShade">clearly contrasted</strong>(i orange here) and instantly recognized as a
                    threat.

                    if you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the street, it is
                    interesting to show them the 30 seconds video before making them try to prototype in order to
                    <strong class="darkShade">understand their </strong> expectations from the video vs the actual game they try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="darkShade">Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help
                        <strong class="darkShade">understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like with the traget used in
                    Viatcheslav Tarasov's PurpleDiver or Fabrika Games'Draw with the spacededicated to drawing.

            <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong class="darkShade">on their phone's Facebook feed,
            </strong> everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer
                screen.
                <strong class="darkShade">You should also consider whether your gameplay videos is understandable if someone watches it on
                    a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an
                    <strong class="darkShade">accelerated elevator pitch!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on Youtube just because it has an
                attractive thumbnail-it's the same idea for your game videos.
